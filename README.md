This includes 2 scripts. The first one, titled PyBank, goes through a company's financial recodrs, stored in a csv file titled "budget_data.csv." The code reads the csv and then goes through every months, and the net profis/losses for each month. From there it finds the month with the greatest profits, along with the month with the greatest losses. It also calculates the average of the changes seen throughout the entire period. At the end it prints all these results and exports them to a text file.
The PyPoll script counts the votes for 3 candidates in an election. It reads the csv file "election_data.csv" to count how many votes each candidate got, and then displays each candidate's vote count, along with the winner of the election. It also exports the results to a text file.
